# LeetCode Problem Collection
This repository contains a curated collection of LeetCode problems categorized by difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each problem comes with its solution, explanation, and approach in C++ and/or Java (may use other languages, however these two are the most often used). The goal of this repository is to help me improve my coding skills by working through different types of problems.

## Repository Structure
- **Easy**: Contains problems that are simple and typically involve basic data structures or straightforward algorithms.
- **Medium**: Contains moderately complex problems, often involving dynamic programming, trees, graphs, or more intricate logic.
- **Hard**: Contains advanced problems that require a deep understanding of algorithms, optimization techniques, and sometimes more advanced data structures.

Each problem folder contains the following:
- Problem Statement: A clear description of the problem, as it appears on LeetCode.
- Solution: An optimized and well-explained solution in C++.
- Approach: A detailed step-by-step breakdown of the thought process and algorithm used to solve the problem.
